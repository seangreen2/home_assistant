## Home Automation Philosophy
***You shouldn't have to work the room, the room should work you.*** True home automation is having your home anticipate what you want without needing any input from you. Using voice commands are nice and all, but that ends up being just another switch you have to use and is ultimately just a remote control, not automation.

I also made the popular dark theme [Slate](https://github.com/seangreen2/slate_theme).
